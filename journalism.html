                <p>This year’s sophomore Homecoming performance holds great significance — it is the first performance for the Class of 2024, who spent its previous school year online. The class officers began preparations as early as the summer, meeting every few weekends to begin backdrop planning and assigning leadership teams for the various tasks that needed to be done for the big day. With Homecoming preparations finalized by the time school began, class officers moved all three dance practices and skit exercises to the Field House for weekly meetings during lunch, with supplementary sessions on weekends at Memorial Park.

                </h2>
                <p>The Pokémon Company and TiMi Studios’ game “Pokémon Unite” released globally for mobile devices on Sept. 22, after originally debuting for the Nintendo Switch in July 2021. Unlike mainstream Pokémon games, which use a role playing game, or RPG model, “Pokémon Unite” falls into the multiplayer online battle arena, or MOBA genre, inserting players into the tropical setting of Aeos Island as a Pokémon Trainer, who directs their Pokémon into competitions against other players.
